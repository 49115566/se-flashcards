      "question": "What is DevOps and what problem does it solve?",
      "answer": "DevOps: Culture/practices unifying Development and Operations. Solves: Silos between dev and ops, slow releases, manual deployments, and lack of reproducibility. Goal: get changes to users quickly, reliably, and securely.",
      "details": "Key principles: Automation, collaboration, continuous improvement, fast feedback, shared responsibility. DevOps is culture first, tools second. Slides summary: getting changes to users quickly, reliably, and securely.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Continuous Integration (CI)?",
      "answer": "CI: Practice of continuously integrating and building code as developers work, with automated builds and tests to gain confidence in frequent changes.",
      "details": "Slides: CI is part of the Build phase—developers create code, the code is compiled and tested in development environments as an artifact for shipping. CI enables early testing and fixes.",
      "category": "CI/CD",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD)?",
      "answer": "CI/CD is the practice that includes continuous integration (frequent builds & tests) and continuous delivery of validated artifacts so they're ready to be shipped to production.",
      "details": "Slides emphasize CI/CD as a key DevOps characteristic and part of Build-Ship-Run: Build and test artifacts then prepare them for shipping and running in production.",
      "category": "CI/CD",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_12-1_devops.md", "startLine": 158, "endLine": 284 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What do build, ship, and run mean in the Build-Ship-Run (pipeline)?",
      "answer": "Slides highlight Build (compile/test), Ship (create and store images/artifacts), and Run (deploy/manage/scale).",
      "details": "The Build phase compiles and creates artifacts. The Ship phase creates Docker images and stores them in registries. The Run phase deploys containerized applications and scales/manages them. These are the stages the slides focus on.",
      "category": "CI/CD",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_12-1_devops.md", "startLine": 158, "endLine": 183 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the Build-Ship-Run workflow?",
      "answer": "Build-Ship-Run: DevOps workflow where code is Built into artifacts, Shipped as images/artifacts to registries, and Ran (deployed & managed) in target environments.",
      "details": "Build: compile and create artifacts; Ship: create and store images (Docker registries); Run: deploy containerized applications, manage and scale services. It's the core flow from development to operations described in the slides.",
      "category": "Workflow",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_12-1_devops.md", "startLine": 158, "endLine": 183 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What are some benefits of reproducible, automated deployments?",
      "answer": "Reproducibility, automation, version control of artifacts, easier rollback and faster recovery, and consistent deployments across environments.",
      "details": "Slides emphasize that Docker images contain everything needed to run, images are stored in registries, and reproducible images plus automated workflows enable faster and more reliable deployments.",
      "category": "Automation",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_12-1_devops.md", "startLine": 178, "endLine": 183 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Containers and why use them for deployment?",
      "answer": "Containers: Lightweight, isolated environments packaging application with dependencies. Docker is most common. Benefits: Consistent across environments ('works on my machine' solved), fast startup, resource efficient, portable.",
      "details": "Container vs VM: Containers share OS kernel (lighter), VMs have full OS (heavier). Dockerfile defines an image; registries store images for distribution. Slides emphasize how containers enable portability, efficiency, and reproducible deployments.",
      "category": "Containers",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_12-1_devops.md", "startLine": 192, "endLine": 197 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is service orchestration and why is it needed?",
      "answer": "Service orchestration coordinates and manages services at scale: deploying, managing, and scaling service instances and routing traffic between them.",
      "details": "Slides mention a service orchestration layer as part of microservices and SOA. Orchestration enables deploying containerized applications, managing running services, and scaling services based on demand.",
      "category": "Containers",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why is monitoring and operational feedback important?",
      "answer": "Slides stress measurement and feedback to drive reliability—monitoring and operational practices help reduce Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) and maintain system stability.",
      "details": "The slides present metrics and benefits (reduced MTTR) and explain that reproducible, automated deployments plus operational monitoring help maintain reliability. Details about specific tools are not covered in the slides.",
      "category": "Operations",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of automated testing in DevOps?",
      "answer": "Automated testing enables CI/CD: Provides confidence for frequent releases, catches regressions quickly, enables fast feedback. Without automation, continuous delivery is impossible.",
      "details": "Test pyramid in CI: Many unit tests (fast), fewer integration tests, few E2E tests. Pipeline gates: Tests must pass to proceed. Test parallelization for speed. Flaky tests are DevOps enemy - fix immediately. Test data management critical. Contract testing for services.",

      "question": "What cultural shift does DevOps emphasize?",
      "answer": "DevOps emphasizes a cultural shift between development and operations teams toward shared responsibility, automation, and continuous improvement to enable faster, more reliable delivery.",
      "details": "Slides list 'Cultural shift' between dev and operations as a primary DevOps effect—DevOps is culture-first and focuses on collaboration and shared responsibility.",

      "question": "What are some benefits and indicators of DevOps?",
      "answer": "Slides highlight increased release frequency (e.g., 13X more releases), portability across environments (41% move workloads across clouds), reduced MTTR (62% reported reduction), faster onboarding (65% reduction), and potential cost reductions.",
      "details": "These data points show that DevOps and containerization can improve agility, portability, reliability, and efficiency. Slides use these indicators to demonstrate real-world benefits of Docker and DevOps practices.",
