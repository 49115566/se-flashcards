    {
      "question": "What is Software Architecture and how does it differ from design?",
      "answer": "Architecture: High-level structure of system - major components, their relationships, and principles governing design/evolution. Design: Lower-level, detailed decisions within architectural constraints.",
      "details": "Architecture = strategic decisions affecting whole system, hard to change later. Design = tactical decisions within a component. Architecture concerns: Component boundaries, communication patterns, technology choices, quality attribute tradeoffs.",
      "category": "Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key responsibilities of a Software Architect?",
      "answer": "1) Define system structure and major components. 2) Make technology decisions. 3) Ensure quality attributes are achievable. 4) Communicate architecture to stakeholders. 5) Manage technical risk.",
      "details": "Architect bridges business and technical concerns. Must understand both requirements AND implementation constraints. Documents architecture decisions and rationale. Reviews designs for architectural conformance. Mentors developers on architectural patterns.",
      "category": "Fundamentals"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 4+1 View Model of architecture?",
      "answer": "Four views plus scenarios: Logical (functionality), Process (runtime behavior), Development (code organization), Physical (deployment). Scenarios/Use Cases connect all views.",
      "details": "Logical View: Classes, packages, interfaces (for end-users). Process View: Threads, processes, concurrency (for integrators). Development View: Source code organization, modules (for developers). Physical View: Hardware, networks, deployment (for system engineers). Use Cases validate all views work together.",
      "category": "Architecture Views"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why document architecture decisions and what core information should be captured?",
      "answer": "Documenting decisions captures rationale and consequences, making it easier to explain choices and onboard team members. Core info: context/problem, decision, reasons, tradeoffs, and who approved it.",
      "details": "Slides emphasize documenting architecture decisions and rationale to explain and persuade stakeholders. Store rationale with code in version control and include context, the chosen decision, consequences/tradeoffs, and status.",
      "category": "Documentation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the relationship between architecture and quality attributes?",
      "answer": "Architecture is the primary determinant of quality attributes (performance, scalability, security, maintainability). Architectural decisions enable or constrain achievable quality levels.",
      "details": "Quality attributes often conflict - can't maximize all. Architecture makes tradeoffs explicit. Example: Microservices improve scalability/deployability but add complexity/latency. Security measures may impact performance. Document tradeoffs in ADRs.",
      "category": "Quality Attributes"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is technical debt and how does it relate to architecture?",
      "answer": "Technical debt: Implied cost of future rework caused by choosing easy/fast solutions over better approaches. Architectural debt is most expensive - affects entire system.",
      "details": "Types: Intentional (known shortcut for deadline), Unintentional (poor decisions). Consequences: Slower development, more bugs, harder to change. Managing: Track debt, pay it down incrementally, avoid architectural debt. Communicate debt to business stakeholders.",
      "category": "Architecture Management"
    },
    {
      "question": "What factors influence architectural decisions?",
      "answer": "1) Functional requirements (what system does). 2) Quality attributes (how well). 3) Constraints (technology, budget, team skills). 4) Organizational factors (team structure). 5) Business context (time to market, scalability needs).",
      "details": "Consider: Team size/distribution, existing systems to integrate, regulatory requirements, expected change areas, operational environment. No 'best' architecture - depends on context. Slides discuss the role of organizational and business constraints in architecture selection.",
      "category": "Decision Making"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between layered and tiered architecture?",
      "answer": "Layers: Logical separation of concerns (presentation, business, data). Tiers: Physical separation/deployment (client, server, database). Layers can be deployed on same or different tiers.",
      "details": "3-Layer: Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access. 3-Tier: Client, Application Server, Database Server. Layers are about code organization. Tiers are about deployment topology. Web app might be 3-layer but 2-tier (client browser + server with all layers).",
      "category": "Architecture Concepts"
  },
    {
      "question": "How do you evaluate an architecture?",
      "answer": "Evaluate an architecture by reviewing it against stakeholder goals and quality attribute scenarios, analyzing tradeoffs, and checking for risks and constraints.",
      "details": "Slides highlight using quality attribute scenarios, stakeholder concerns, and tradeoff analysis to evaluate architecture. Identify risks where decisions may not meet goals; propose mitigations. Document evaluations and recommendations.",
      "category": "Evaluation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is architectural erosion (drift) and how do you manage it?",
      "answer": "Architectural erosion (drift) occurs when the implementation diverges from intended architecture over time. Manage it with regular architecture reviews, code/design reviews, and by keeping documentation and interface contracts up to date.",
      "details": "Causes: time-to-market pressure, unclear architecture, ad-hoc changes. Prevent by documenting architecture, reviewing changes for conformance, and refactoring when violations are found. Encourage shared design ownership and maintain interfaces.",
      "category": "Architecture Management"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a component in software architecture?",
      "answer": "Component: Modular, replaceable unit with well-defined interfaces. Encapsulates implementation, exposes services through interfaces, can be independently deployed/developed.",
      "details": "Components interact through interfaces (provided) and dependencies (required). Good components: High cohesion internally, low coupling externally, clear contracts. Examples: Authentication module, payment processor, search service. Components at different granularities.",
      "category": "Architecture Concepts"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of interfaces in architecture?",
      "answer": "Interfaces define contracts between components: what services are provided, expected inputs/outputs, and quality guarantees. They enable loose coupling and substitutability.",
      "details": "Slides discuss interfaces as contracts between components. Types include APIs (programmatic), protocols (network), and file formats (data exchange). Good interfaces are stable, documented, and versioned.",
      "category": "Architecture Concepts"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is evolutionary architecture and how can you design for change?",
      "answer": "Evolutionary architecture enables incremental change and evolution of the system over time. Design for change by choosing reversible, modular architecture decisions, and by enabling regular refactoring and review.",
      "details": "Slides recommend: delay irreversible decisions, prefer modular styles (microservices, layered), keep interfaces stable, and review architecture frequently to support continuous evolution versus big-bang redesigns.",
      "category": "Architecture Principles"
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you document software architecture?",
      "answer": "Document: Architecture views (4+1), component diagrams, deployment diagrams, ADRs, quality attribute scenarios, constraints. Audience-appropriate: Different views for different stakeholders.",
      "details": "Good documentation: Current, concise, explains rationale (not just structure). Include: System context, container diagram, component diagram, deployment view, cross-cutting concerns. Tools: C4 model, UML, arc42 template. Living documentation preferred.",
      "category": "Documentation"
    },
    {
      "question": "What are cross-cutting concerns in architecture?",
      "answer": "Cross-cutting concerns affect multiple components: logging, security, error handling, caching, transactions. Challenge: Can't be modularized into a single component - they span the system.",
      "details": "Slides show cross-cutting concerns are resolved using shared libraries, frameworks, middleware, and design patterns where appropriate. Important to address them at the architecture level to avoid inconsistency and duplicated logic.",
