    {
      "question": "What is Object-Oriented Analysis (OOA) and what are its goals?",
      "answer": "OOA identifies and describes objects/concepts in the problem domain, establishing their attributes, behaviors, and relationships. Goal: Model the problem domain before designing a solution.",
      "details": "Key outputs: Use case specifications, analysis classes, interaction diagrams, and class diagrams. Focus is on WHAT the system needs to do (analysis), not HOW (design). The analysis model should be implementation-independent.",
      "category": "OOA Fundamentals",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 26, "endLine": 68 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between OOA and OOD?",
      "answer": "OOA focuses on WHAT needs to be modeled (domain concepts, responsibilities, interactions); OOD refines the analysis into HOW the system will implement those concepts (software classes, methods, design details).",
      "details": "Slides show OOAD iteration from requirements → analysis → system design → architecture → component & class design; analysis is implementation-independent while design is solution-oriented.",
      "category": "OOA Fundamentals",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 26, "endLine": 51 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Use Case Model and what does it contain?",
      "answer": "A Use Case Model describes functional and non-functional requirements using actors, use cases, system boundaries, and use case specifications that define basic flows and interactions.",
      "details": "Slides define a Use Case Model as Use Case diagrams and use case specifications; components include actors, use cases, associations, and system boundaries. Example: Course Registration System example in slides.",
      "category": "Use Case",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 72, "endLine": 122 }
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you identify candidate classes/objects during analysis?",
      "answer": "Underline noun phrases in use case specifications, leverage domain expertise, and filter candidates by removing duplicates, attributes, and implementation constructs.",
      "details": "Slides recommend underlining noun clauses in use case specs and applying a filtering approach: remove duplicates, synonyms, implementation constructs and reserve attributes and operations for later.",
      "category": "Domain Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 228, "endLine": 236 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Domain Model and what does it contain?",
      "answer": "A Domain (analysis) model is a representation of domain concepts, their attributes, and relationships — a problem-space view that omits implementation details.",
      "details": "Slides show analysis classes, associations, and attributes identified from requirements and stress that Analysis class diagrams focus on WHAT exists in the domain rather than methods or visibility.",
      "category": "Domain Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 155, "endLine": 172 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What are common types of UML associations and when do you use them?",
      "answer": "Associations show relationships between domain classes; use aggregation for loose whole-part, composition when part lifecycle depends on whole, and dependencies for weaker temporary links.",
      "details": "Slides present association details and multiplicity examples (Student-Schedule, Schedule-CourseOffering, CourseOffering primary/alternate multiplicities) and explain using composition when lifecycle is tied to container.",
      "category": "Associations",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 580, "endLine": 620 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What does multiplicity in UML associations mean and what are common notations?",
      "answer": "Multiplicity defines how many instances of one class relate to another. Examples: 1, 0..1, *, 1..*, and ranges like n..m. Multiplicity influences foreign keys and collections.",
      "details": "Slides show multiplicity examples (Student-Schedule, CourseOffering primary/alternate) and explain multiplicity is included during modeling and affects implementation decisions.",
      "category": "Associations",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 514, "endLine": 620 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Model Unification and why is it important?",
      "answer": "When multiple use cases produce different analysis models, unify them by merging common classes and relationships to create a single, coherent class diagram.",
      "details": "Slides describe the unification process (create analysis models for each use case, find common classes, and merge them) and cite benefits including single consistent view, reuse, and reduced duplication.",
      "category": "Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 616, "endLine": 668 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What association details should you capture in class diagrams?",
      "answer": "Capture the relationship name, multiplicity, navigation (direction), and any attributes/roles associated with the relationship; these drive design and implementation decisions.",
      "details": "Slides include an Association Details table for the Course Registration example and demonstrate how to record multiplicities (0..1, 0..*, 0..4) and navigation indicators.",
      "category": "Associations",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 580, "endLine": 620 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the difference between attributes and associations in class diagrams?",
      "answer": "Attributes are simple data values (string, int) located inside a class; associations represent relationships to other domain objects and are shown as lines between classes.",
      "details": "Slides recommend making a concept an attribute if it's primitive/simple; make it a class with an association if it has its own attributes or behavior. Examples and attribute lists in the CourseOffering entity illustrate this.",
      "category": "Domain Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 536, "endLine": 568 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a System Sequence Diagram (SSD) and what does it show?",
      "answer": "An SSD shows the sequence of messages between external actors and the system (viewing the system as a black box) and highlights the operations invoked by use case interactions.",
      "details": "Slides present sequence diagrams as time-oriented views that show objects, messages, lifelines, execution occurrences and message numbering and provide a clear, per-use-case view of interactions.",
      "category": "Sequence Diagrams",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 307, "endLine": 324 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key differences between Analysis and Design class diagrams?",
      "answer": "Analysis diagrams model domain concepts (WHAT) with attributes and relationships; design diagrams add methods, visibility, implementation detail, and patterns (HOW).",
      "details": "Slides note analysis is a problem-space view focusing on domain classes and interactions, while design is the solution-space view that includes operation signatures, visibility, and design patterns.",
      "category": "OOA Fundamentals",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 632, "endLine": 668 }
    },
    {
      "question": "How do you determine if something should be an attribute vs. a separate class?",
      "answer": "If it has its own attributes, behavior, or is referenced independently, model it as a class; if it’s a simple primitive value tied to one object, make it an attribute.",
      "details": "Slides include examples and recommend deferring attributes during initial class identification and converting complex values into separate classes when needed for clarity and reuse.",
      "category": "Domain Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 242, "endLine": 252 }
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is domain vocabulary important in analysis?",
      "answer": "Use consistent domain terms between developers and domain experts to reduce miscommunication and ensure models reflect real business concepts.",
      "details": "Slides emphasize that use case and domain vocabulary should be used consistently in requirements, specifications, and diagrams to improve clarity and prevent 'nomenclature drift'.",
      "category": "Domain Modeling",
      "slide_ref": { "file": "wk_5-1_ooa.md", "startLine": 132, "endLine": 172 }
    },
    {
      "question": "What are boundary, control, and entity classes in analysis?",
      "answer": "Boundary classes represent interfaces to actors, control classes orchestrate use case logic, and entity classes model enduring domain objects and their data/behavior.",
      "details": "Slides define <boundary>, <control>, and <entity> stereotypes, recommend one control class per use case, boundary classes per actor/use case, and entity classes for key domain abstractions.",
